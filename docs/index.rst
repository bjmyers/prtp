Welcome to PRTP's documentation!
================================

The Python Raytrace Package (PRTP) is a package of Python functions that simulate X-Ray instruments. It was designed for the McEntaffer Group at the Pennsylvania State University. PRTP expands on the functionality of `PyXFocus <https://github.com/rallured/PyXFocus>`_, but with a more intuitive, modular design.
